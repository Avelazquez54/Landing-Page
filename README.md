# Landing-Page
Created a generalized website page based on the instructions given from the open source project, The Odin Project.
The project revolves around putting the HTML and CSS skills I learned during my time going through the lessons provided by the amazing people at The Odin Project.

Plenty of trail and errors were made and done to test and correctly implement the website according to the template given to us as shown in the photos below.

Any advice on how to improve it is greatly appreciated! Always looking to make it more professional and improve my web development skills!
